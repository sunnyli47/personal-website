*"I don't call myself a perfectionist but I will try my best on everything and minimize the chance that something could go wrong."*

It'd been a long long time since I last had a haircut due to COVID and my hair was growing longer and longer. Mom cut my hair a bit once during the quarantine, but when I asked her to cut shorter, she resufed because she was not entirly confident about her cutting skill (though she has done multiple cutting "experiments" on my dad and my dad quite liked how they all turned out, "给女生剪头发完全不一样。" （woman cut is a different story） she said.) So, I have to find a hair salon, a good one. 

To begin with, I barely knew any hair salons despite of living in nyc for five years because I used to go wherever my mum got her haircut. For the first time I'm going to pick a hair salon I like and this is probably my first step to adulting? Taking risks and being responsible for whatever decisions I made. 

In the following week, I spent a few hours each day to do research on hairstyles and hair saloons, including but not limited to, what kind of haircut do I like? Do I have a concave or convex profile? Is this saloon good at cutting short hair? Which stylist? etc. I don't call myself a perfectionist but I will try my best on everything and minimize the chance that something could go wrong. Finally, after browsing through tons of yelp, reddit and google reviews, I finalized my decision: **Techni Salon**, the best I can find out there. It turned out that all of my efforts has paid off and I really like my new hair style and my stylist Jason!!

Here to present hair salons that many people mentioned/I've come crossed, and some of personal comments on each of them:

## Asian Salon

- [Techni Salon](https://www.yelp.com/biz/techni-salon-ny-new-york-6) **(the salon I chose to go to eventually)**

  - They have the best yelp reviews I’ve seen so far. Every hair stylist is great, esp. Jason and Juno.

- [Kiwa Salon](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kiwa-salon-new-york-2?q=short)

  - A lot of great yelp reviews plus they have student discount!

  - But... not sure their hair stylists’ aesthetic matches mine…

- [Hair Kuwayama](https://www.yelp.com/biz/oro-x-hair-kuwayama-new-york?start=20&q=Kaori)

  - Con: Hair stylists are all great.

  - Pro: BUT they require credit info upon schedule an appointment (Many yelp reviews complained this as a privacy issue).

    - Inconsistent price: charge extra fees that are not matching what has listed on the website. (source: yelp reviews)

    - SUPER EXPENSIVE

    - Two separate websites, confusing

- [Redge Salon](https://www.yelp.com/biz/redge-salon-new-york)
  - Pro: online booking
    - Recommended by redditors.

  - Con: 7 one-star reviews and some three-star reviews too

- [Assort International Hair Salon - New York](https://www.yelp.com/biz/assort-international-hair-salon-new-york-new-york?sort_by=rating_asc&q=akina)

  - Pro: a reputable hair salon in Japan

    - online booking 

  - Con: Limited option - has only one hair stylist for haircut 

- [MG Hair Artistic Salon](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mg-hair-artistic-salon-flushing-2)

  - Pro: good at coloring

  - Con: many yelp reviews say it has hygiene issues (hair in the sink, not clean, terrible haircut, not as expected)

- [Kominotech](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kaminotech-new-york)

  - I've personally been to this hair saloon before but I found my hair stylist didn't shampoo my hair before cutting. I am not sure if it's a japanese thing, the hair cut turned out alright. 



## Non-Asian Salon

- [Hair Date](https://www.yelp.com/biz/hair-date-new-york) - temporarily closed during COVID

  - In <https://ny.racked.com/maps/best-salons-nyc>, it says “stylists work to meld your cut requests with their 'artistic vision' to create a look suited to your face shape and texture needs” but I didn’t see any yelp reviews reflect this part.

  - Great for short hair

- [Bumble&Bumble](https://www.yelp.com/biz/bumble-and-bumble-new-york-2)

  - PRO: Recommended by redditors

  - CON: More than three pages of one-star yelp reviews...



## Hair-related

- The difference between highlights and balayage

Highlights almost always use foils whereas balayage is more of a visual hand-painted technique. Balayage will always give a more subtle result than traditional highlights.

- For round face (yes, that's me)

No straight bang!!! It will emphasize the bottom half of your face and makes it look rounder.
