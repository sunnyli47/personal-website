#### POMONA Behind-the-Wheel test

Search "Pomona Driving test" on YouTube and there are three common routes that evaluator would take. Take a picture of the routes and go practice those routes on a Sunday when the DMV is closed.

- ask the evaluator to put on seat belt if they play *dumb*
- start: go straight, complete full stop in front of the stop sign, check traffic coming from both sides, be careful with the curb
- left turn, if there is no incoming traffic, no need to stop, slow down and turn directly
- the turning point is 15mph, slow down smoothly and then accelerate
- be careful with those bumps
- at stop sign: if the view is obstructed, full stop before the white line and then creep up check the traffic and go
- right after the stop sign left turn, be ready to make a left turn again
- after get back to DMV 
  - **BE CAREFUL** with cars that are backing up!!!
  - speed limit is **5 mph**
