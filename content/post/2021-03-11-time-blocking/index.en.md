It takes a great amount of time and effort to manage my everyday life. I was thinking about how I should start programming everyday and also doing a bunch of other things I want to do each day. And here are my ideal daily routines and the estimated time I want to spend on each:

- 2 hr python programming
- 1 hr web dev
- 1 hr leetcode practice
- 1 hr writing daily reflection
- 2 hr eating
- 2 hr workout

total = 9hr

I can’t say this is not doable but as you can see it is a huge time commitment to make those routines happen. I need myself to realize that sticking with routines takes time and it is hard to live everyday of our lives well-managed, sometimes we often just prioritize the tasks we have to finish first and sacrifice the time of doing other things. 

### So, would time blocking possibly help me to achieve those daily goals? 

[Time blocking](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking) is a time management method that divides a day into several chunks of time. I’ve tried this method when I was in elementary school and most of the time I ended up not sticking to the schedule I made because I always underestimated the time I needed to finish one task. I still have this habit of listing so many things I want to do and try to squeeze them into one day. However, I have to learn how to better manage my time in order to become more productive and efficient. Time blocking would be my first try.
