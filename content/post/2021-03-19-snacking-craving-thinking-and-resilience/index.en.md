##### Snacking and craving for food happen when your mind is wandering and not functioning, thus you have no control over yourself

##### How do I start thinking so deeply? Is it because of what I’ve read, listened, experienced OR is it simply because my brain became more mature? i.e. my frontal lobe has become more and more developed? or is it the mixture of two? that I did the right thing at the right time => double bonus

##### Resilience
- the ability to adjust yourself, your mindset, goal and motivation
- deal with anxiety and stress

##### Storytime: 

When I went out for a run today, I wore the wrong earpods!! I wore the right earpod in my left ear and the left in my right ear...and I didn’t realize until after. No wonder my right earpod kept falling off and I had to hold it throughout the time 😂 

Also, I’m pretty sure there is some kind of pressure sensor on the surface of the earpod, cuz when I stopped pressing on it, my podcast ep stopped playing. And it would resume once I added some pressure on it.
