I came across a new podcast today called [**Over-thinking**](https://notoverthinking.com/). Honestly the thing that made me not quit at first is the host’s british accents HAHA it’s a different kind of podcast compared to the others that I’ve been listening to because the two hosts on the show are more like having a casual talk instead of doing a podcast. And it is also interesting that I found they don’t sound that nice to each other, sometimes even being quite spicy and sarcastic, which is uncommon in the podcasts that I’ve listened to in the past (or most podcasts talking about serious shit). (e.g. when one of them throws a thought out, another would be like “oh really?” in a doubtful tone) But later (literally just a few minutes ago), I googled it and found out they are actually brothers! AHA everything makes perfectly sense now.

Ali & Taimur talked about social media and how it is hard for people to be sincere on those platforms. They mentioned one of the reasons is people being human. It is human nature for us to always try to present the best of ourselves to others. But when the “others” become countless people behind the screens that you cannot estimate, the feeling of insecurity and the fear for judgment multiplies. A person’s stories and past experiences attract people alike. And for a person to tell her/his own stories, they are showing some of their vulnerabilities too. For someone like me, I found it is hard not only to be vulnerable on social media, but also to be measured by the amount of likes and comments. Even though social media *is* part of our lives now, I still believe there are other better ways to build a more personal and stronger connection other than it. 

#### Something Ali & Taimur mentioned that I think it’s worth noting down:
- Book rec: [Storyworthy by Matthew Dicks](https://matthewdicks.com/storyworthy/)
  - Matt also writes a blog everyday and he also posts his 50 yearly goals and updates the progress monthly which I found to be inspirational and also respect how he is being candid about it even some of the goals fall through.
