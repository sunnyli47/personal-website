COVID really changed me a lot-- I can say for sure that I was NOT that type of person who would start some casual chatting to some random strangers. BUT! TODAY! I went out of my way to make some great conversations happen and I did not regret it a bit! I met Saro-- my lyft driver, who has a son that graduated from UCLA in 2005 and went to get a master degree in USC (yikessss). She works three days at a dental office in Corona and drive lyft for the rest of the week. I told her how I used to live in New York and chose to go to college here because the weather is always so great, and she told me she has a cousin who moved to Maryland for work and decided to move back to Cali after only 6 months because she couldn’t bear with the freezing weather and wearing multi-layers clothes all day, which I found to be hilarious. Rosa has also kindly shared her experience of learning how to drive from her brother when she just graduated from high school, and told me she was so nervous with driving at first that her brother, who was sitting next to her while watching her practice, was even more relaxed than herself. After telling her that I have a driving test next week, she asked me to remember to stop three inches before the white line when there is a stop sign, otherwise it’s gonna be an immediate fail. And since we were in a residential area with many stop signs around, she even demonstrated it to me how to do it.

I got a chance to talk with Aniram and Tibbar at the dental office. I had to take off my earrings because I need to take a panoramic X-ray for my teeth. And after that, I was trying to put it up but realized I couldn’t find the hole in the back of my right ear to pull it through and meanwhile there were some liquids coming out of my piercing hole as well, so Aniram to help me put it on. She was really nice and was speaking to me in a sympathetic tone “Oh noo it’s bleeding, why are you doing this to yourself Sunny?” And I noticed that she doesn’t have earrings, surprisingly! I thought most people in the States got their first ear piercing when they were in kindergarten.

Tibbar lives in somewhere that’s really close to my house and when she asked me if I lives far away from here (somehow they all knew that I moved far away haha guess people love gossiping no matter what their occupation is), she knew exactly where that is (yes, most people have no idea and often just respond with “Oh! That’s a sick name!”). I was amazed by her commitment to come to work here because it’s a LONG commute back and forth every day! But she then told me she only comes to work three days a week. She has a daughter who goes to high school and her school is open now but students only go there two days a week for three hours (11am-2pm), which “is basically nothing” as she said. But I told her “at least she is seeing her friends in person” which she agrees with.

And the last random person I talked to today was my another Lyft driver Sherman who drove me back home. We didn’t have that much of a conversation per se but when I hopped into the car, he was jokingly asking me “Where are you going?” I looked at him from the rearview mirror, quite puzzled, thinking “does he not know where I am going? Isn’t it on the app?”. So I didn’t respond to him. And he quickly followed: “San Diego?”. I looked even more confused and it was too absurd to a point that I started laughing and repeated “San Diego???” And then he laughed loudly too and said “Let me check, oh no no no, it’s XXXX” “YEA that’s rightr” I replied. “I wish it was San Diego tho” I said jokingly too while waving goodbye to Jade, the friend that I visited today.

Those small talks lightened up my day besides meeting with my friend and I am so glad that I talked with every one of them. I also found that it is always great to start the conversation with someone by asking their name, in which it will make them feel more valued in the first place, and their names also help me to remember what they look like and some of their characteristics.
